Public Repo for the International Snack Explorer Database.

Welcome to the International Snack Explorer!

I love to traveling and food, which inspired this project. There have been many times that I have gotten overwhelmed in foreign grocery stores, struggled to translate the language and packaging of snacks, and overall just missed the mark on what to purchase. The International Snack Explorer solves this problem by using the Open Food Facts database to show travelers the most popular food and drink items in different countries, providing them with clear information as to what they should seek out at the supermarket. This website allows users to search for the top 5 most popular packaged snacks for a selected country from the drop down menu. Product popularity is determined by product scans from the Open Food Facts API. Users also receive dietary and allergen information in their search result. This project is aimed towards travelers, international students, new residents, and even just curious food lovers like myself.

This project welcomes collaboration and additions, details of which will be explained in the Developer Manual linked at the bottom of this page.
This website is designed for desktop and mobile browsers, including: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge, iOS, Android, and Samsung. These browsers are designed to support HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Vercel-deployed API calls.

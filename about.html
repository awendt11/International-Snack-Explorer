            <h2>How This Website Began</h2>
            <p>
                As a self-proclaimed traveler and foodie, I love traveling and trying new foods, but grocery shopping in a foreign country 
                can be overwhelming. Different languages, unfamiliar brands, and unclear ingredients 
                make it difficult to know what is popular or safe to eat.
            </p>
            <p>
                The International Snack Explorer was created to help travelers, students abroad, 
                and curious food lovers discover well-known snacks from selected countries using 
                real data from the Open Food Facts API.

            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>When visiting or living in another country, it can be hard to figure out:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Which snacks or drinks are well-known or commonly purchased</li>
                <li>What allergens or dietary restrictions apply</li>
                <li>How to read ingredient lists in another language</li>
                <li>What local brands and flavors exist</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                To simplify popularity, this project uses the <strong>unique number of barcode scans</strong> 
                (<em>unique_scans_n</em>) from Open Food Facts. This is a straightforward, measurable way 
                to highlight the top 5 snacks in each country.
